Academic Consumption and Student Performance Case Study
This project explores the relationship between academic consumption (such as study habits, time spent on assignments, etc.) and student performance. Using Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scipy.stats for statistical analysis, the goal is to identify how various factors influence academic outcomes and detect any outliers that may skew the analysis.

Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the student data using Pandas to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and prepare it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key metrics, such as time spent studying, grades, and other academic behaviors using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Outlier Detection: Used statistical methods from Scipy.stats to identify and handle outliers in the dataset that may distort results.
Correlation & Insights: Investigated the correlation between study habits, academic consumption, and student performance to provide actionable insights.
